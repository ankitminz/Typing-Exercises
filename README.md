# Typing Exercises
These typing exercises are meant to practice specific keys. For example: **J220_1** is for practicing letter *J* and it contains 220 or less characters in while **J5000_1** contains 5000 or less characters and **J** contains all characters in one file.

You can practice these in [Keybr](https://www.keybr.com/) or [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/login). I took the words from [Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com).
